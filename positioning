      <div class="c1">The Mahabaleshwar Temple, Gokarna is a 4th-century CE Hindu temple located in Gokarna, Uttara Kannada district,
    Karnataka state, India which is built in the classical Dravidian architectural style. It is a site of religious
    pilgrimage. The temple faces the Gokarna beach on the Arabian Sea. The temple deifies the Pranalinga ("the reality of
    God which can be captured by the mind") also called Atmalinga or Shiva Linga[1] In legend, it is said that the deity of
    the temple will bestow immense blessings to devotees, even to those who only glimpse it.[2][3] Currently the
    administrative charge of the temple is with an Overseeing Committee under the Chairmanship of Justice BN Srikrishna, a
    Retired Justice of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India.[4] It is one of the 275 paadal petra sthalams expounded in the
    Tevaram, a sacred Tamil Shaivite text written during the 6th and 7th centuries by 63 saints called Nayanars.</div>

    <div class="c3">Goa (/ˈɡoʊə/;[9] Konkani: [ɡõːj]; Portuguese: [ˈɡoɐ] ⓘ) is a state on the southwestern coast of India within the Konkan
    region, geographically separated from the Deccan highlands by the Western Ghats.[10][11] It is bound by the Indian
    states of Maharashtra to the north, and Karnataka to the east and south, with the Arabian Sea in the west. It is India's
    smallest state by area and fourth-smallest by population. Goa has the highest GDP per capita among all Indian
    states,[6][12] two and a half times as high as the GDP per capita of the country as a whole.[13] The Eleventh Finance
    Commission of India named Goa the best-placed state because of its infrastructure, and India's National Commission on
    Population rated it as having the best quality of life in India (based on the commission's "12 Indicators").[13] It is
    the second-highest ranking among Indian states in the human development index.

        an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was
        commissioned
        in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) to house the tomb of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal;
        it
        also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which
        includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.

    Uttar Pradesh, Varanasi lies on the left bank of the river. It is 692 kilometres (430 mi) to the southeast of India's
    capital New Delhi and 320 kilometres (200 mi) to the southeast of the state capital, Lucknow. It lies 121 kilometres (75
